Students are also introduced to meshed topologies for engineering analysis and toolpath generation for component manufacture. ISO and ANSI standards for coordinate dimensioning and tolerancing are covered with an introduction to Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T). Parametric Technology's ProEngineer 3D CAD solid modeling software is used throughout the course to create associative models at component and assembly level with automatic blueprint creation, interference checking, and linked Bill of Materials.
