How do they create, exploit and vindicate intellectual property (""IP"") assets and capabilities in competition with others at home and abroad? We will address these critical questions, and gain a better understanding of what IP is, how firms nurture its creation, protect and meter its use, and integrate it into the broader competitive strategy of the firm. We will also investigate different types of IP legal regimes around the world, and investigate how multinational firms manage these regime differences for competitive advantage globally. We will do this through review and discussion of published legal decisions, international agreements and business case studies designed to highlight practical challenges that managers face when deciding how best to protect, transfer and or exploit IP within and across markets.

Further, the tools of economics can be used to analyze almost every aspect of sports from players to consumers to the organization of the firms and teams.  Data tend to be very easy to find on this subject, so empirical work is abundant. There are several main topics we will cover:   1.	Labor issues.   This includes (but is not limited to) things like salaries, monopsony, labor unions, and discrimination.  Are college athletes exploited?  Are professionals paid too much?  How much is a player really worth? 2.	Antitrust issues.  There is wonderful history of laws and lawsuits in sports over market power.  Are leagues monopolies?  Should they be regulated?  How is bargaining structured in the world of sports? 3.	Public good provision.  At what level should government be involved in funding sports teams?

For majors only. Prerequisite: Completion of the Composition I requirement and ENGL 200.,3 hours.,,Humanities – Lit & Arts,34214,X  ,"Theory: the final frontier. At least that?s how many U of I English majors seem to feel!  In this course, we will survey major developments in the history of thinking hard from the eighteenth century to today. Along the way, we will ask a series of interrelated questions about the rise of Western reason that theory both performs and critiques.  For example:  Was the rise of Enlightenment thinking emancipatory or repressive?  How did such patterns of thinking emerge alongside material developments like early capitalism and empire? Are aesthetics essentially a-political or does art participate (for good or ill) in the world of politics and power?  Can historicism serve as a corrective to the gross inequities of our world, or is it a Trojan horse left behind amongst the other wreckage of the Enlightenment? And what does any of this have to do with reading sonnets, plays, and novels? 	Major players in this story are likely to include Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Benjamin, Horkheimer, Adorno Lukacs, Barthes, Derrida, Foucault, Habermas, Butler, Sedgwick, Said, and the great and inscrutable Gayatri Spivak.  As in any theory course, a number of major -ISMs (and their relatives) will appear regularly on the docket?including materialism, historicism, structuralism (and its posts-), queer theory, and postcolonialism. But to cope with the vertigo an ISM always produces, we will generally read short, iconic selections, thinking for the most part in broad strokes, with a few full texts interspersed for depth and texture. And we will find a way to work through this material that: a) makes sense, b) challenges you, and c) does not put any of us to sleep (or drive us mad). This is, in short, an introduction to the history of such ideas, and any lively, alert, game young reader will be able to keep up.  It is strongly recommended that all English and Teaching of English majors take ENGL 300 and ENGL 301 BEFORE taking any other 300- or 400-level courses.",,,,,,S1,2013-05-13Z,2013-06-07Z,0,LCD,Lecture-Discussion,12:00 PM,02:50 PM,MTWR   ,1062,Lincoln Hall,"Loughran, P"
