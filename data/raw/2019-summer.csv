Of course, in the wake of global terrorism, we’ve witnessed nations that invoke bellicose rhetoric, but we’ve also seen a nearly unprecedented wave of superhero texts that attempts to respond to, challenge, and, in many cases, foster this rhetoric. Why have heroes become so political? Well, that’s precisely what we’ll aim to figure out in this course. The class will trace out the logic of Western cultural nationalism by assessing its need to establish heroic ideals that also serve as ideological apparatuses. Certain types of heroes appear in the cultural imaginary at moments of crisis, and this course will explore what function these fictional heroes serve for a nation’s real populace. We will also explore a few texts that question traditional models of heroism, texts that tend to think that heroism, like more vulgar forms of nationalism, never really holds up to careful scrutiny. Required Texts will include -Doyle, Arthur Conan.  Sherlock Holmes: The Major Stories -Claremont, Chris and John Byrne, The Dark Phoenix Saga -Fleming, Ian.
