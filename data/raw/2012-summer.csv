This program gives students an opportunity to ?shadow? attorneys and judges at multiple legal jobs by spending time with legal professionals during a typical workday.  That day will vary, but it may involve participating in any of the following with a legal professional: attending client meetings, preparing for court or hearings, attending court appearances or hearings, meeting with other lawyers, or observing court hearings or trials.  In addition, students will conduct an informational interview or informal question-and-answer session about the profession with their externship host.   Sites for this externship program are expected to be in DuPage County (Wheaton) and McLean County (Bloomington-Normal). Externs will be assigned to externship sites and matched with legal professionals by the program coordinator. Externships will last one week beginning either June 18 or June 25. Students will need to make their own arrangements for transportation to externship sites.  Students in all undergraduate majors are welcome. Interested students should submit a letter of interest and resume to Jamie Thomas-Ward, Director of Pre-Law Services , Center for Advising and Academic Services, 807 S Wright Street, Floor 5, M/C 317, Champaign, IL  61820 by Friday, April 20 at 4:00.  The letter should indicate site preferences, student availability for particular dates, and match of student interests to available sites.  Students will be notified during the week of April 30 and will be matched to available externship sites by program coordinators.  To participate, students must be registered and remain concurrently registered in PS 305: The Supreme Court (CRN: 36371). Students accepted into the program may register for the internship course, PS 199: Legal Externship (CRN 36372).  Students completing the externship will receive one credit hour in addition to three credit hours for PS 305.  Questions?
