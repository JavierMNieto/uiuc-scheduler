See GER 250.,3 hours.,1LA,Humanities – Lit & Arts,34386,A  ,"We read classical and little-known tales from the Grimms' 19th-century collections, as well as earlier tales and other texts, focusing on how power, gender, race, class, and ecological issues play out in these surprisingly meaningful and very old stories. Why do we continue to tell these tales? Why do certain stories recur again and again, in Western and other cultures? The power of narrative is at the center of our lives, and of these tales, and by the end of the semester we will understand this power much better.

Sessions will be recorded, so attendance at these times is not required. This course addresses the ways in which knowledge is represented, with special reference to the knowledge representations of teachers and learners. Its interdisciplinary bases are functional linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, history of ideas, media/communication studies, and ontology in computer science. The focal point of the course is the five questions about meaning posed by Cope and Kalantzis in their transpositional grammar: “what is this about?” (reference); “who or what is doing this?” (agency); “what holds this together?” (structure); “how does this fit with its surroundings?” (context); and “what is this for?” (interest). Along these lines of inquiry, a transpositional grammar addresses language, image, embodied action, object and space. “Transposition” refers to the movement across these various forms of meaning, intensified in the era of pervasively multimodal, digitally-mediated communications. Applied to education, not only does this provide a valuable heuristic to reframe literacy teaching and learning (the original impulse for the development of this grammar). It also offers an integrated account of meaning-to-learn across all subject areas, including pedagogical content knowledge and learner knowledge representations. Conceived in the broader terms of social-scientific research methods, transpositional grammar is an attempt to overcome the narrowness and logocentrism of “the language turn” which dominated social sciences in the twentieth century. In a practical sense, semiotics of the kind explored in this course also provides tools for reading and interpreting multimodal texts and research data.",Restricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.,,,,,,,,0,ONL,Online,05:30 PM,07:30 PM,M      ,,,"Cope, W"

Sessions will be recorded, so attendance at these times is not required. This course addresses the ways in which knowledge is represented, with special reference to the knowledge representations of teachers and learners. Its interdisciplinary bases are functional linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, history of ideas, media/communication studies, and ontology in computer science. The focal point of the course is the five questions about meaning posed by Cope and Kalantzis in their transpositional grammar: “what is this about?” (reference); “who or what is doing this?” (agency); “what holds this together?” (structure); “how does this fit with its surroundings?” (context); and “what is this for?” (interest). Along these lines of inquiry, a transpositional grammar addresses language, image, embodied action, object and space. “Transposition” refers to the movement across these various forms of meaning, intensified in the era of pervasively multimodal, digitally-mediated communications. Applied to education, not only does this provide a valuable heuristic to reframe literacy teaching and learning (the original impulse for the development of this grammar). It also offers an integrated account of meaning-to-learn across all subject areas, including pedagogical content knowledge and learner knowledge representations. Conceived in the broader terms of social-scientific research methods, transpositional grammar is an attempt to overcome the narrowness and logocentrism of “the language turn” which dominated social sciences in the twentieth century.

2020,Summer,KV,GWS,Gender and Women's Studies,378,Fairy Tales & Gender Formation,"Discusses how femininity and gender formation are related through fairy tales. As children grow they are taught the difference between male and female roles. One of the main ways this instruction takes place is through the pleasurable media of fairy tales in books, poems, and more recently, films. Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Beauty and the Best, and the Little Mermaid, among others, will be examined to understand how sexual identity is constructed differently in different cultures, and how issues such as rape and incest are addressed within the narratives. The readings explore the ways that fairy tales work to express psychological reactions to maturation while conditioning both characters and readers to adopt specific social roles in adulthood.

First, educators should be aware of recent developments in the area of instructional technology. Second, educators must be able to select, develop, and effectively use appropriate instructional technologies to enhance learning and communication. To meet these needs, this course covers a wide range of instructional technologies that are used for instructional and administrative purposes. Traditional instructional media are considered in the course although significant emphasis is placed on more recent developments that involve the use of the computer and its applications in education. Instructional technologies such as computer-based instruction, computer-based testing, distance learning, interactive video, and intelligent instructional technologies are covered. Through course readings, discussions, and projects, students in the course are expected to gain skills in choosing appropriate instructional technologies, designing effective presentations that rely on those technologies, and properly using instructional technologies to enhance communication with an audience.
