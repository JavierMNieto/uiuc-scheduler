Philosophy is sometimes described both as the love of wisdom and the search for truth.  We will not just be asking what these 3 dead guys had to say.  We will be asking what is true and what is false regarding the following questions. What is real? What can be known? Is knowledge of God possible? Where does morality come from?

The student will be introduced to the basic laws of reasoning and also to some of the most common fallacies which occur in reasoning. This discussion will be applied to a wide range of sample arguments taken from law, ethics, science and politics, as well as from everyday life.        Special Feature:  LSAT track.
