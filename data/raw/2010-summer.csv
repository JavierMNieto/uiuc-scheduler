We will be using pdf files that are available online at  http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/index.html This course will focus on the philosophies of Rene Descartes (1596-1650), David Hume (1711-1776), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804).   Philosophy is sometimes described both as the love of wisdom and the search for truth.  We will not just be asking what these 3 dead guys had to say.  We will be asking what is true and what is false regarding the following questions. What is real? What can be known? Is knowledge of God possible? Where does morality come from?  The assignments will all be online short essay questions rather than papers or in-class tests.

The course is intended to help the student follow and evaluate the arguments of others, and to develop, present and defend his or her own arguments. The student will be introduced to the basic laws of reasoning and also to some of the most common fallacies which occur in reasoning. This discussion will be applied to a wide range of sample arguments taken from law, ethics, science and politics, as well as from everyday life.        Special Feature:  LSAT track. Since both the LSAT and GRE exams emphasize problems of the kinds we?re going to discuss, there will be optional (extra credit) assignments consisting of problems taken directly from the LSAT, and supplementary discussions of them.
