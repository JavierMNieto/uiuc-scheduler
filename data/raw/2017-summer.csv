Contemporary art and design are explored through the use of semiotics and historical, cultural and ethical aesthetic and technical perspectives.",3 hours.,1LA,Humanities – Lit & Arts,35192,JB ,"Online. This course meets synchronously online through Blackboard Collaborate on the class times/days.  ART 100 gives students the means to understand, analyze, and enjoy a wide variety of visual forms, from traditional fine arts like painting, drawing, and architecture to imagery such as folk art, graffiti, and fashion photography. Objects as simple as a potato peeler and as complex as a contemporary sculpture installation are examined to evaluate both their specific formal qualities and their wider cultural meanings. We study the places and spaces of the contemporary world from the suburbs to the city, from the crooked city streets of old Paris to the carefully constructed environments of Disneyland and Chicago public housing. Although the objects we consider are quite diverse, we use the same core methods of formal, semiotic, and contextual analysis to create a durable framework for understanding visual culture.",,Humanities – Lit & Arts course.,,,,S1,2017-05-15Z,2017-06-09Z,0,ONL,Online,05:00 PM,06:20 PM,TR     ,,,"Burns, J"

Does not fulfill Shakespeare requirement for the English major. Prerequisite: Completion of the Composition I requirement.",3 hours.,1LA,Humanities – Lit & Arts,38673,X  ,"English 218 ‘Introduction to Shakespeare’ is designed for students who wish to become more familiar with Shakespeare’s plays; the class also satisfies the pre-1800 requirement for English and Teaching of English majors as well as for CW majors. Teaching of English majors are welcome to adapt assignments to help build Shakespeare-related teaching materials suitable for the middle- or high-school classroom; CW majors are also welcome to adapt at least one writing assignment to incorporate the writing of original poetry or fiction. Over the course of the summer session we’ll read eight plays by Shakespeare:  Titus Andronicus; The Taming of the Shrew; Romeo and Juliet; Midsummer Night’s Dream; the Q1 Hamlet (this is the so-called “bad” version of Hamlet: “To be, or not to be, aye there’s the point”); The Merchant of Venice; Macbeth; and finally, Othello. I have also assigned Tiffany Stern’s Making Shakespeare from Stage to Page; I’ll be drawing from that text in order to give you some insight into Shakespeare-the-theater-professional rather than Shakespeare-the-Bard—in other words, William Shakespeare was an actor and a playwright with a financial stake in the theater company to which he was attached. His fellow actors, the physical spaces of the Globe and the Blackfriars theaters, and any number of material factors necessarily shaped the plays he wrote. Expect each class meeting to include a range of activities, from lecture to discussion to group work to the watching of film clips and, to be sure, the active blocking and performing of scenes from the plays (no experience required or necessary!) Evaluation will be based on consistent and engaged participation; one group performance project; one mid-term and one final examination; and two or three short written assignments, at least one of which can be adapted to meet students’ individual creative and professional goals. COURSE AIMS: By the course’s conclusion we’ll have discussed how the plays reflect the material conditions of Shakespeare’s theater; we will have learned to see the play-text as offering a range of different options for performance; we will have read the plays for the performance cues suggested by, and embedded in, the plays’ language; and finally (and most important) we will have asked ourselves how and why Shakespeare’s plays continue to be revised, recast, and reinterpreted.

Whether we’re following a Twitter feed, watching the television news, or visiting the local mall, messages about “the environment” daily permeate our minds.How are such forms of communication created? How might they affect our perspectives, understanding, and even behavior in regard to environmental issues?This course explores such questions about environmental communication, while also immersing you in real-life material, and even transforming you into an environment journalist for a day. Drawing primarily from the discipline of communication, it opens with some core concepts about the social construction of terms like ‘environment’ and ‘nature’ and ‘science’. Then three sections focus on representations of nature in popular culture, green advertising, environment as news, and a set of case studies.

This course is a comprehensive examination of environmental contaminant pathways into the environment, fate and effect of toxic substances resulting from human activities, and ecosystem effects of contaminants. Topics include an introduction to basic principles of toxicology, discussion of differences in species’ response to toxicants, survey of major classes of toxicants, environmental exposures, toxicants in consumer products, and ecotoxicology. We will address research techniques for both human health and ecotoxicology, as well as measures to reduce exposure and remediate contaminated systems. Students will learn how to interpret toxicological data and analyze results. By the end of the course, students should have a basic understanding of toxicological pathways, biological effects, and environmental consequences and be able to apply this knowledge to a variety of current environmental toxicology situations.",,,,,,,,,0,ONL,Online,07:00 PM,09:00 PM,T      ,,,"Johnston, T"

2017,Summer,KR,UP,Urban and Regional Planning,443,"Scenarios, Plans & Future Cities","This course teaches theories and tools of scenario analysis, a set of techniques useful for making plans and creating more sustainable future cities. Scenario analysis can be used to think about multiple facets of a problem simultaneously and for addressing the uncertain future in light of the limited cognitive and computational capacity of individuals and organizations. Urban planners and policymakers are adopting and extending scenario approaches to envision the future, analyze decisions, and identify robust strategies in situations as varied as comparing projected outcomes of alternative routes for highway investment, to making decisions in situations when formal regulatory mechanisms may be lacking. The need for knowledge and skills in this area is reflected in (1) the growing use of scenario analysis as a required method in many government-funded planning initiative in the United States and around the world, (2) new courses and workshops offered by urban planning programs and professional trainers, such as the American Planning Association and Planetizen, and (3) the sprouting of scenario planning support tools, such as Envision Tomorrow and Index PlanBuilder. 3 undergraduate hours. 3 graduate hours.
